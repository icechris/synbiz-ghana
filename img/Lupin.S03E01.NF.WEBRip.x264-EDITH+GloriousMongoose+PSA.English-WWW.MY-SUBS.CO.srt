00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,080
It's called the Arii Poerava,
also known as the Black Pearl.

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,920
This pearl ended
the French-Tahitian War in 1847.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,240
It is considered priceless.
They're expecting you at Quai Branly.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
Central Precinct will contact you
if there are any security breaches.

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,760
- Do you have your phone?
- Affirmative.

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,280
- Hello.
<i>- Michael, listen carefully.</i>

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,880
<i>If you're already in the car,
respond by saying that it's nice outside.</i>

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,720
- Who is this?
<i>- This is Central Precinct.</i>

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,520
<i>If you've already gotten in the car,
say it's nice out.</i>

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,840
- It's nice out.
<i>- Perfect. Michael, it's not safe.</i>

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,160
<i>We have reason to believe that your driver
is working for a criminal organization.</i>

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
<i>Emergency protocol is in effect.</i>

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,120
You know the drill.
Get dropped off at Trocadéro Plaza.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,720
Take the metro.
It's safer for you and the pearl.

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,960
<i>Take the south train
to the end of the line.</i>

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,760
<i>- Our agents will meet you there.</i>
- Okay.

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,720
Change of plans.
Drop me off here, please.

18
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,840
No, no. There's no way!

19
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,160
No!

20
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,400
Come back!

21
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
Stop him! Thief! He has the pearl!

22
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,520
{n8}Hey. Hey, you.

23
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,040
{n8}Hey, you.

24
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
{n8}Hey, how you doin'? I'm home.

25
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,040
Good boy.

26
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,360
<i>A year after his incredible stunt
at the Pellegrini gala,</i>

27
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,360
<i>France's most famous burglar
has yet to be caught.</i>

28
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,400
<i>While police claim to have several leads,
no arrests have been made.</i>

29
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,000
{n8}<i>Experts say his vanishing act would not be
possible without help from accomplices,</i>

30
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,920
<i>or possibly...</i>

31
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,640
You're my accomplice.

32
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,880
<i>While current leads
have yielded no results,</i>

33
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,840
{n8}<i>Assane Diop's former wife
is considered a suspect,</i>

34
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,520
{n8}<i>though she claims ignorance.</i>

35
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,840
{n8}<i>She is being closely watched
by the police and the media as well.</i>

36
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,840
{n8}<i>Leave us alone!
Please, leave us alone!</i>

37
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,800
{n8}<i>I don't know where he is!</i>

38
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,440
{n8}<i>I don't know where he is!
Why don't you get that?!</i>

39
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,400
<i>Leave us alone!</i>

40
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,360
All right, J'accuse.

41
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Time to go home.

42
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,920
- Good night.
- Good night.

43
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,880
UNKNOWN NUMBER
ORANGE UMBRELLA. IN 2 MINUTES.

44
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Claire?

45
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Claire, hold on. Please, Claire, wait!

46
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,640
- Let go of me, Assane!
- I...

47
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
I know you're angry.

48
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,400
- I know how you and Raoul feel.
- Oh yeah? You know?

49
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
You know what?

50
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
You know the fear? Shame?

51
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,240
You know how people stare at us,
how Raoul wakes up screaming at night?

52
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,640
- I swear to...
- No!

53
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,200
Don't say it because you're not sorry
about what you did.

54
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,280
Just shut up, Assane. I'm done.

55
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,080
We can leave, Claire.
Raoul, you, and me.

56
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,560
Let's leave France,
go somewhere where nobody knows us.

57
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,680
I bought tickets
on a cargo ship leaving in 48 hours.

58
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,880
You know what I just realized?

59
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,400
You're insane. Completely insane.

60
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,800
You think Raoul
and I would leave everything for you?

61
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,040
We can be together.

62
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Be a family.

63
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,320
We wouldn't be a family.
We'd be on the run!

64
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,920
Is that the life you want for your kid,
always having to look over his shoulder?

65
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,160
- You really want to fix things?
- I'd do anything for that.

66
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Okay.

67
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
Then turn yourself in.

68
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,440
It's the only solution.

69
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,040
That's what I thought.

70
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,440
You're not a hero, Assane.

71
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
You're scared.

72
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,320
What did you expect? For her to follow you
and just drop everything?

73
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
No, but I was hoping
she'd be glad to talk.

74
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Assane!

75
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,080
You just... Do you realize
what her life has been like this year?

76
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,440
She's always getting questioned
and harassed!

77
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,360
- It's a living hell.
- I know.

78
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,680
Look! She's on every front page this week.

79
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,840
HIS WIFE BRAINWASHED?

80
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,120
I know, Ben.

81
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Okay.

82
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
What now?

83
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
I have a plan, Ben.

84
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But it's risky.

85
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,560
- Tricky. Dangerous.
- How bad on a scale from one to ten?

86
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Probably a 12.

87
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
It's a big job, Ben.

88
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
<i>The</i> job.

89
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,120
Of course.

90
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,840
- It all starts with this.
- The Black Pearl.

91
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,760
Stop right there!

92
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Police!

93
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Out of the way!

94
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,640
Stop him!

95
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,000
Come on!

96
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,720
Hey!

97
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,840
- Don't move!
- Hold on, guys! Stop, I'm a cop!

98
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm a cop!

99
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,640
Nice try, but this is my badge.

100
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,800
Let's bring him in.

101
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
<i>My one failure.</i>

102
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,800
You know I gotta fix my mistake.

103
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,480
Don't make the same mistake twice.

104
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,240
If I have to disappear,
gotta do it with a bang.

105
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
You bastard!

106
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,320
WANTED: ASSANE DIOP

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
<i>Hero or criminal?</i>

108
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,280
<i>France is still making up its mind
about Assane Diop.</i>

109
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,000
<i>According to various sources, he's been
spotted all over France in various...</i>

110
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,200
I can't believe
how insane people are over this guy!

111
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,440
We've had this crook on our front page
for months and nobody knows where he is.

112
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,960
There's... there's nothing left to say.
It's, it's...

113
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,280
This whole thing is insane.

114
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,400
It's a mystery.

115
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,760
It isn't insane.
And readers love a mystery.

116
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,360
Franck, she's just trying to make herself
look good here. It's pretty obvious.

117
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,880
It's obvious it's been three months

118
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,200
since you've been on the front page,
so you're jealous.

119
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
You know what I see here?

120
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,960
Two journalists in competition.

121
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,120
That sounds good to me.

122
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,680
But you know the rule. You don't like
the headline? Find a better one.

123
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

124
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

125
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,320
Your helmet, please.

126
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,000
- I just have this letter.
- Please remove your helmet.

127
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Here.

128
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,960
Are you okay, ma'am?

129
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
You...

130
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,440
You look like that man.

131
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh, that guy?

132
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,520
Tell me about it!

133
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,560
He's ruining my damn life.
This happens every day!

134
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,960
Now you too? I'm over it!

135
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,200
Luckily, I'm more handsome.

136
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,200
And, of course,
my eyes are a different color.

137
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,640
What color are my eyes?

138
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,880
- Brown.
- Exactly.

139
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,600
These bad boys are saving me.
Otherwise, I'd be arrested by now.

140
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,840
- Can I get a signature?
- Yes, sir, of course.

141
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
It makes sense you're nervous.

142
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
This seems like a place he'd want to rob.

143
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Assane Dop.

144
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,200
No, um... Diop.

145
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,400
Diop. Not... not Dop.

146
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,640
Assane Diop. That's right.

147
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,400
I remember now. I'm Michel Beaumont.

148
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,600
And you?

149
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Elizabeth.

150
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,760
Have a good one, Elizabeth.

151
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,960
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

152
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,920
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

153
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
Mr. and Mrs. Branville.

154
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
So lovely to see you again.

155
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,680
- How are you?
- Very good, thank you.

156
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,640
- Very well.
- Wonderful.

157
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,480
Usually we come down this way.
We can check over there.

158
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,600
Of course, madam. Um...

159
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,560
You can count on us. It's no problem.

160
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,760
I'll see you soon. See you soon. Goodbye.

161
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Goodbye.

162
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,320
Mr. Imbert, this is for you.

163
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,160
Thank you. Oh, excuse me.

164
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
Hold on for a moment.

165
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,640
I have something for you.

166
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Oh my goodness!

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,840
Hello, Captain.

168
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,880
- Commander Félix, from SWAT.
- Commander.

169
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,160
Our men are reinforcing
the security system.

170
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,080
Aren't we waiting
for confirmation it's real?

171
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,400
No, Captain.
A threat is like a live grenade.

172
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,120
We have to defuse it before it blows up.
Major, deploy your men.

173
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,920
We need to get this area secure now.

174
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
Of course, Commander.

175
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,960
"Dear Mr. Imbert,
I hope this letter finds you well

176
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,120
and that your hair stylist did a good job
during your coloring session on Monday."

177
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
"Being robbed is an unpleasant experience

178
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,280
and I find it's best
for one to be prepared for that."

179
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,720
"I assume your heart,
like your hair, is fragile."

180
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,480
"I thought it best to spare you the shock
and give you an advanced warning

181
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,680
that I plan to steal your Black Pearl."

182
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,600
"I will steal it at 10 p.m. sharp
on the evening of Friday, December 3rd."

183
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,600
"P.S. Allow me to express my sympathies
for any disturbances I may cause."

184
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
"Yours respectfully, Assane Diop."

185
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,960
- You're sure that he wrote that?
- He handed it personally to Mrs. Simon.

186
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,600
- You saw him?
- Yes.

187
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,440
But how can you be sure it was Diop?
He's usually in disguise.

188
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,400
Yes, of course.
Of course, it was very subtle.

189
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,320
He... he put in some contacts
to change his eye color. They were brown.

190
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,680
Brown? His eyes <i>are</i> brown.

191
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
He...

192
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,640
He said his name was... Michel Beaumont.

193
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,040
Right. We have to keep this a secret.

194
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,000
No one can know Diop has returned.

195
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,960
- Understood?
- Understood.

196
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,760
- Can we see your surveillance footage?
- Uh, yes. It's, uh...

197
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,960
- Can you switch cameras?
- Of course.

198
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
There!

199
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,760
He's got one hell of a nerve.

200
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,760
He disappears for a year,
then just walks back in.

201
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
He's screwing with us.

202
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,480
What kind of thief
would invite you to his robbery?

203
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,320
Pass the ball!

204
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,040
Block, block!

205
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,440
Go, go, go!

206
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,440
- Coach, call foul!
- What?

207
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,560
That was a foul.

208
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
- Whoa, whoa!
- Stop being such a baby, Diop.

209
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,080
It was a foul play. Free throw.

210
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,720
- Can't shoot for shit.
- Hey!

211
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,280
- Diop, you suck. You're gonna miss!
- You suck!

212
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,160
Come on, pussy, relax.
I'm sure your dad's up there watching you.

213
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,800
Knock it off!

214
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,160
Oh, no, my bad. He doesn't give a shit.

215
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,720
Hey, hey, hey!

216
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,880
Knock it off!

217
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,640
- So stupid.
- It's always the same with you!

218
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,760
- Not our fault.
- I'm not here to babysit you!

219
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
You're too old for this!

220
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Benjamin!

221
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Hey, Assane.

222
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,520
What's up for your vacation?

223
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,640
Benjamin! Come on!

224
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,920
Paul invited me to his country house.

225
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,600
You're going? You hate Paul.

226
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,040
Our parents are friends.
I don't have a choice.

227
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,880
Okay, well...

228
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Have fun, then.

229
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,440
Assane...

230
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Hold on!

231
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Hey!

232
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,440
Oh, excuse me. Assane!

233
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,320
You lived in Montreuil, right?

234
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,200
On Resistance Avenue?

235
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,200
Yeah, with my father. Why?

236
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,240
I got a call from the new tenant.
They've got your mail.

237
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,240
- They want you to get it.
- It's probably just junk mail.

238
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,120
- They can throw it away.
- He said there were letters from Senegal.

239
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,520
- From Senegal?
- Yes, letters from your family.

240
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,960
Hmm, something like that.

241
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,000
Thanks. Thanks so much.

242
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,560
Okay, that's enough!

243
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,160
Practice is over!

244
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,680
- Seriously?
- Really?

245
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,200
Everyone you know abandons you.

246
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,560
Hey! Meet me outside.

247
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,040
Let me guess. Diop has returned.

248
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Got it.

249
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,160
- Tell me everything.
- Hold on.

250
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,560
- Just tell me.
- This isn't your case anymore.

251
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,480
Don't do this.
You know it's not just any case for me.

252
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,080
That's why you're here, right?

253
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,880
So, tell me. Where is he?
What's he done? Spill it!

254
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,280
He dropped this off with a jeweler
on Place Vendôme.

255
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,320
And he did it in person.

256
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,840
"Dear Mr. Imbert,

257
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,520
I hope this letter finds you well
and your hair stylist did a good job..."

258
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,880
"Being robbed is an unpleasant experience
and I find it's best..."

259
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,200
Same guy, still top of his game.

260
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,400
You find something?

261
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Let me explain.

262
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,720
Lupin often sends his victims a warning
before robbing them.

263
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Grab the letter.

264
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,680
Look here, at the end of his letter.

265
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,320
"Allow me to express my sympathies
for any disturbances I may cause."

266
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,161
"Please accept my humble apologies.
Yours respectfully, Arsène Lupin."

267
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,440
By announcing the theft,
we're forced to show our hand,

268
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,200
which makes the pearl even more...

269
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Vulnerable.

270
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Yeah.

271
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,440
Was the only thing he left behind
the letter?

272
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Uh, no.

273
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,880
He gave a fake name. Beaumont.

274
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,880
- Michel Beaumont?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

275
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,880
In <i>The Crystal Stopper,</i> that's his alias.

276
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,960
Why is he always making
these references to Lupin?

277
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,480
Because he's playing with us.

278
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,440
That's the way he's always done things.

279
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,760
Always one step ahead of us.

280
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,320
- Who else knows about the letter?
- No one.

281
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,520
Take a look at this!

282
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,120
That's what we call a real scoop.
Pay attention.

283
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,760
Fleur here is a real journalist.
Watch and learn.

284
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,480
Margaux, this letter goes
on the front page tomorrow.

285
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,480
I don't know how you did it,
but very well done.

286
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,840
- Keep going.
- Thank you.

287
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,600
Bravo, Fleur!

288
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,160
Whoo!

289
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,520
<i>He's back!
In a letter published this morning</i>

290
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,360
<i>on the front page of</i> The Objector,

291
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
<i>the most famous fugitive
in France announced</i>

292
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,040
<i>he is going to steal the Black Pearl,</i>

293
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,560
<i>a priceless gem seized
during the French-Tahitian War in 1846.</i>

294
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,480
<i>Diop states the time
and place of his next hit.</i>

295
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,840
<i>December 3rd at precisely 10 p.m.
at Place Vendôme.</i>

296
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,040
<i>Well, Mr. Diop, if you're watching this,</i>

297
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,960
<i>it's very kind of you to give France
fair warning before your next job.</i>

298
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,560
<i>- We'll be there.</i>
- Oh God. Just great.

299
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,880
It'll be chaos.

300
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,960
Sylvain, I want maps
and access points to all buildings,

301
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,920
and video footage from Place Vendôme.

302
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
Close down the whole area!

303
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,760
Max, call the SWAT commander.
We're on maximum alert.

304
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
You got it.

305
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,920
If Diop shows up, we'll be ready.

306
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,880
I've heard that one before.

307
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
We have 43 cameras here on site.

308
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,600
Another one here.

309
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,160
<i>Motion sensors in every room.</i>

310
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,960
<i>How many exits?</i>

311
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,960
<i>Six, counting
the service stairwell.</i>

312
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,200
- Any codes?
- A four-digit code.

313
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,960
- Same one for every door.
- You should change it now.

314
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,120
We change it weekly.

315
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,640
Have you changed it
since you got the letter?

316
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,400
I'll change it right now.

317
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,600
It's possible, Mr. Imbert,
that Assane Diop has already been here.

318
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,320
Maybe he's watching now.

319
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,080
The threat is real, Mr. Imbert.
Don't take this letter lightly.

320
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,880
This is really high up.

321
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,680
- We're on the second floor.
- Yeah, a fear of heights is terrible.

322
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,640
All right.

323
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,760
The further you go
to the center of the room,

324
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,960
the more valuable
the items on display are.

325
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,600
That's the reason why the Black Pearl
is right here, in the center.

326
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
It's worth more
than all our jewels combined.

327
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,320
The pearl should be
behind bulletproof glass.

328
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,680
We're better than that. Look.

329
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,600
ACTIVATE MAIN GALLERY
ALARM ACTIVATED

330
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,400
If you touch one of these beams...

331
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,520
ALARM DEACTIVATED

332
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,080
Good, that's perfect.
I'll have my men covering the room.

333
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,280
- Oh? How many men?
- Just enough, Mr. Imbert.

334
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,800
I can assure you
no one will lay a finger on your pearl.

335
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,440
The nation's honor is at stake.

336
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
What?

337
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,480
You remind me of your mom.

338
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,040
If he's coming tonight, we won't miss him.

339
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,120
I have to show you something.

340
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,560
I'll be back.

341
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,880
- You have the code?
- Imbert gave it to me.

342
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,120
- What the hell's going on?
- They're all here for Diop.

343
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,040
Fucking Robin Hood.

344
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,720
Robin Hood gave
what he stole to the poor.

345
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,160
Diop gets revenge for them.

346
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,280
No, no, not this time. No.

347
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,160
Major, I need you and your men to move in.

348
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,320
- Let's go!
- Assane Diop!

349
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,480
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

350
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,880
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

351
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,800
Go!

352
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,200
Assane Diop!
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

353
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,640
I never thought I'd ask you this,
but should I read the original books?

354
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
What are you talking about?
What books?

355
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,040
The books. Arsène Lupin.

356
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,720
<i>"Lubar"?</i>

357
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,880
Never heard of it.

358
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,920
<i>Guédira, I'm serious.
Don't make me beg!</i>

359
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,280
Took you long enough. Let me explain.

360
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,680
If you wanna catch him,
you need to know Lupin.

361
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,640
<i>- What do you need to know?</i>
- You tell me.

362
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,680
I'm trying to anticipate his next move.

363
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,240
<i>No, you don't get it,
you can't do that.</i>

364
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,520
<i>- The guy's a con artist.</i>
- You're not helping.

365
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,280
I need you to think
and tell me how he'd pull it off.

366
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,800
No idea. He'll probably try
to distract you.

367
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,120
<i>in place? Impossible!</i>

368
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,800
He's a gentleman thief.
He always finds a way.

369
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,360
Unless he's stolen it already.

370
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,120
- Are you serious?
- That would be a very Lupin thing to do.

371
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,240
Is this the original?

372
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,600
Of course it is. Why even ask?

373
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
No one could've exchanged it
without you knowing?

374
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,480
On my watch? Impossible.

375
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,800
<i>He hasn't stolen it.</i>

376
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,160
In 2017,
some guy tried to steal it.

377
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,600
We got the pearl back,
but the guy got away.

378
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,160
Guy's description sounded like Diop.

379
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,600
And if it was him,
that means it's his only failure.

380
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,080
<i>Okay,
SWAT will inspect everything closely.</i>

381
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Yeah.

382
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,560
Hundreds have come
in the hope of catching a glimpse

383
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,040
of the most wanted fugitive
currently being searched for in France.

384
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,320
If he pulls this off tonight,
as he announced on social media,

385
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
we could be standing

386
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,440
in front of what could be
the most daring burglary in history.

387
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,680
Assane Diop!
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

388
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,040
Assane Diop!

389
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
Who the hell are you?

390
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,560
Diop. Assane Diop.

391
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,840
I used to live here.

392
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
Thank you.

393
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,120
"Tell Sanni Mom loves him,

394
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,960
but he's better off without me."

395
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Mama.

396
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Give me all your money!

397
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,440
Bro, what's
with the dorky clothes?

398
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,400
- Bruno!
- Oh, sorry, did I freak you out?

399
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,120
When did you become such a wimp?

400
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,520
- You good?
- Yeah.

401
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,920
Come on, we'll miss the match.

402
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,400
France is doing great.
There's no way we'll lose.

403
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
<i>He passes to Thierry once again.</i>

404
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,000
<i>He's dribbling down the field,
going in for the goal.</i>

405
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
<i>He goes and shoots,</i>

406
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,000
<i>and he is blocked!</i>

407
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,000
<i>They've got the ball
and they're traveling toward the goal.</i>

408
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,800
<i>All of France is watching
for the outcome of this game.</i>

409
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>Thierry has been
the star player this time,</i>

410
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,040
<i>getting all of the goals for this game.</i>

411
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,400
<i>He's gotten two goals
and he's on a hat-trick.</i>

412
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,280
<i>- Thierry has recaptured the ball.</i>
- Oh!

413
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,280
<i>Thierry's got it, heading in
on the goal, lines up, he shoots!</i>

414
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,280
<i>Goal!</i>

415
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,040
- Yeah!
<i>- This wins the game!</i>

416
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,800
- Yeah!
<i>- Amazing! Thierry again...</i>

417
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,120
Thank you, Thierry!

418
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,040
Thank you!

419
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,120
<i>...going to the finals
of the World Cup!</i>

420
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,320
- Hey!
- Yeah?

421
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,040
Can I stay with you? For a few days.

422
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,080
<i>...victory for France.
The crowd is going wild.</i>

423
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,240
Of course, man.

424
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,440
<i>You can feel the excitement
for the people of our country.</i>

425
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,800
- Captain Belkacem, everything is in order.
- Get the shutters and alarm.

426
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,680
The alarm is activated.

427
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,120
Mr. Imbert, come on.

428
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,320
Assane Diop!
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

429
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,520
Assane Diop! Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

430
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,640
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

431
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,800
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

432
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,760
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

433
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,960
ASSANE MAKES THE 1% PAY

434
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,000
- If he ran, I'd vote for him.
- You want a thief for President?

435
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,040
<i>He's not the thief, the others are!</i>

436
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,120
<i>All these cops for one man?
They'll never catch him!</i>

437
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,360
<i>What is it
that draws you to Assane Diop?</i>

438
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,880
<i>He's the voice of the people!
That's my man!</i>

439
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
<i>Assane Diop! Assane Diop!</i>

440
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,480
WHO'S NEXT?

441
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,320
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

442
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,840
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

443
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,840
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

444
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,360
Assane Diop! Assane Diop! Assane...

445
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
All right, thanks.

446
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,200
All good downstairs.

447
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,400
Ten! Nine!

448
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,320
Eight! Seven!

449
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,000
<i>Six!</i>

450
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,320
<i>Five!</i>

451
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
<i>Four!</i>

452
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,600
Three!

453
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,760
<i>Two!</i>

454
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,920
<i>One!</i>

455
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,720
Zero!

456
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,480
DIOP: PLACE VENDÔME BURGLARY

457
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,000
Whoo!

458
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,920
No, no, no, no, no, no!

459
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,720
Open the door! The code!

460
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,120
On our way.

461
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Come on, hurry!

462
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,800
Go, go, go, go!

463
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,360
Where is it? Come on, move, move!
The hallways, the hallways! Go!

464
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,080
What the hell happened?
Where's the pearl?

465
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,040
Hello!

466
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,080
This is impossible! Take off your mask!

467
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,480
Shit! He has to be nearby.

468
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,040
You, take off your mask!

469
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
What...

470
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
But...

471
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Look.

472
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,760
There! But...

473
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,160
Check the exits!
The upper floors too!

474
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,960
What is it?

475
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,520
Some officer is making his way
to my office using all the building codes!

476
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,080
<i>- What? Are you serious?</i>
- I can see him right now.

477
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,360
Vidal! Diop is upstairs! Now!

478
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,160
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

479
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

480
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,760
Assane Diop! Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

481
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,040
- There, there!
- Go, go, go!

482
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,280
Come on, hurry up!

483
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,080
Would you hurry up?

484
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,880
Let me do it, idiot!

485
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,360
Open the door now!

486
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,960
Mr. Imbert, you changed
the code earlier. Hurry up!

487
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,720
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm not a mechanic!

488
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,640
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

489
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,560
Assane Diop! Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

490
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,360
Assane Diop! Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

491
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,560
Assane Diop! Assane Diop! Assane...

492
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Diop!

493
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,000
All units to the courtyard! Now!

494
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,080
You, don't move!
Don't move! Stop resisting!

495
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I said don't move!

496
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,840
Spread your legs! Stop resisting!

497
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,000
- Give me your hand!
- We're taking you in!

498
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,560
Give me your hand!

499
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,640
Let's go.

500
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,480
All units,
we're exiting through the front.

501
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,200
- The Black Pearl...
- My one failure.

502
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,640
Let him go!
Free Assane Diop! Let him go!

503
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,480
Free Assane Diop!
Let him go! Free Assane Diop!

504
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,680
Here he is!

505
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,360
Free Assane Diop!
Let him go! Free Assane Diop! Let him go!

506
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,920
<i>Free Assane Diop! Let him go!</i>

507
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
<i>Free Assane Diop! Let him go!</i>

508
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,480
<i>Free Assane Diop!
Let him go! Free Assane Diop!</i>

509
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
Let him go!
Free Assane Diop!

510
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,880
Let him go! Free Assane Diop!
Let him go! Free Assane Diop!

511
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,120
Let him go! Free Assane Diop!
Let him go! Free Assane Diop!

512
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,200
<i>And now, coming up,</i>

513
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,720
<i>we've got a discussion

{n8}3 DAYS EARLIER

515
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
{n8}Bruno here?

516
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,080
- Can I come in?
- Bold of you to come here.

517
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,960
I don't know what you're doing
and I don't care. Come in.

518
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Thanks.

519
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,240
Take a seat. He won't be long.

520
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,520
<i>Hero or criminal?</i>

521
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,200
<i>France is still making up its mind
about Assane Diop.</i>

522
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,760
<i>According to various sources,</i>

523
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,720
<i>he's been spotted all over France,
in various locations.</i>

524
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,160
{n8}<i>The police are doing everything they can</i>

525
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,000
{n8}<i>to check out every possible lead,
even ones that may seem suspicious.</i>

526
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,720
<i>Looking to the overseas territories,
police haven't ruled out the possibility</i>

527
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,960
<i>that he could have escaped
out of the country.</i>

528
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,360
<i>Unfortunately,
this does broaden the search.</i>

529
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,400
<i>However, many experts believe
Assane is still in France,</i>

530
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,960
<i>his work as a thief not finished.</i>

531
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Hey, Bruno.

532
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,800
I'm here to pay my debt.
Got an offer for you.

533
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,120
<i>So here's the plan.
Meet me tomorrow at dawn.</i>

534
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,600
<i>At Place Vendôme.</i>

535
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,480
You remember Benjamin Férel?

536
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,760
- Hey, Bruno.
- Hey.

537
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Go on.

538
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,480
<i>Inside the pillar
is the perfect hiding spot.</i>

539
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Look.

540
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,520
Earpiece.

541
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,960
Here. For you.

542
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,000
Stay in contact, okay?

543
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Your outfit.

544
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,640
<i>You're gonna pose
as a recently transferred SWAT commander.</i>

545
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,080
- Hello. Commander Félix from SWAT.
- Commander.

546
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,680
<i>Take control of the operation.</i>

547
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Our men are reinforcing
the security system.

548
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,720
Aren't we waiting for confirmation
it's real?

549
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,600
No, Captain.
A threat is like a live grenade.

550
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,640
<i>Act natural.
They won't question anything.</i>

551
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,840
Major, deploy your men.
We need to get this area secure now.

552
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,760
Of course.

553
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
<i>The bigger the lie,
the more they buy it.</i>

554
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,160
I want to know everything
about their security systems.

555
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,320
<i>You'll be my eyes and ears.</i>

556
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,600
<i>- Ready, Commander?</i>
- Uh-huh.

557
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,320
Adjust your badge if you read me.

558
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
Very good. Get in there.

559
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,680
Ask to see the manager, Mr. Imbert.

560
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,080
<i>We have 43 cameras here on site.</i>

561
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,600
Another one here.
Motion sensors in every room.

562
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,320
<i>How many exits?</i>

563
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,720
<i>Six, counting
the service stairwell.</i>

564
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,360
<i>- Ask him for the codes.</i>
- Any codes?

565
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,120
A four-digit code,
same one for every door.

566
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,800
- Change it right now.
- You should change it now.

567
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,600
<i>I'll change it right now.</i>

568
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,560
Say that maybe I was already there.

569
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,720
<i>It's possible
that Assane Diop has already been here.</i>

570
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,920
<i>Or maybe he's watching now.
The threat is real, Mr. Imbert.</i>

571
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,680
Don't take this letter lightly.

572
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,120
<i>Okay, turn around.</i>

573
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,080
Shit.

574
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,640
Oh, this is high up.

575
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,880
This is really high up.

576
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,520
We're on the second floor.

577
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,320
Is he stupid?

578
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,400
Yeah, a fear of heights is terrible.

579
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,640
CODE ALTERED

580
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,080
<i>The Black Pearl is right here.</i>

581
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
In the center.

582
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,360
It's worth more
than all our jewels combined.

583
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,880
They have lasers protecting the pearl,
but that's not something you know.

584
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,360
<i>Tell him to put it
behind bulletproof glass.</i>

585
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,360
The pearl should be
behind bulletproof glass.

586
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,640
We're better than that. Look.

587
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,160
<i>The more interest you show
in his pearl, the more he'll trust you.</i>

588
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,400
Tell him that this job
protecting the pearl is personal for you.

589
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Actually, wait.

590
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,320
Tell him the honor of France is at stake.

591
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,600
I told you. The bigger the lie, man...

592
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,880
Well, good. That's perfect.

593
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,560
I'll have my men covering the room.

594
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,360
<i>- Oh, how many men?
- Just enough, Mr. Imbert.</i>

595
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,240
I can assure you
no one will lay a finger on your pearl.

596
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,600
The nation's honor is at stake.

597
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,600
Explain to me why I had to send
a copy of the letter to <i>The Objector.</i>

598
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,560
We gotta fill the square with people.

599
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,240
What's the best way to announce
your party? Send invitations.

600
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,040
Take a look at this.
That's what we call a real scoop!

601
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,640
I don't know how you did it,
but very well done. Keep going.

602
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Thank you.

603
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,440
Don't forget the news.
There's a lot of viewers.

604
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,160
<i>Mr. Diop, if you're watching this,
it's very kind of you</i>

605
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,400
<i>to give France fair warning
before your next job.</i>

606
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
{n8}<i>We'll be there.</i>

607
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,720
Assane Diop!

608
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,720
<i>There's perks
to being a wanted man.</i>

609
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,680
- I need you and your men to move in.
- Let's go!

610
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,920
Assane Diop! Assane Diop!

611
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
<i>Act One. We use the crowd
to infiltrate the SWAT unit.</i>

612
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,520
<i>Neither seen nor heard.</i>

613
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

614
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,440
<i>Ten!</i>

615
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Nine! Eight!

616
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,520
<i>Seven!</i>

617
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,880
<i>Six! Five!</i>

618
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,840
Four!

619
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
<i>Three!</i>

620
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
<i>Two!</i>

621
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,440
<i>One!</i>

622
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,720
Zero!

623
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,400
What the hell happened?
Where's the pearl?

624
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,080
I don't know. It's just gone.

625
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,280
This is impossible. Take off your mask!

626
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,240
Shit! He has to be nearby.

627
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,280
<i>Act Two. We make our escape.</i>

628
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,960
<i>With the right code,</i>

629
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,160
<i>you can open any door.</i>

630
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,440
<i>And if you want
to avoid unexpected visitors...</i>

631
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,760
<i>...you just change the code.</i>

632
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,520
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm not a mechanic!

633
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,720
If I say it's not working,
it's not working!

634
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,040
<i>I'll be at the rendezvous point
in two minutes.</i>

635
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,640
Mr. Imbert, you changed
the code earlier. Hurry up!

636
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,320
<i>And finally, Act Three...</i>

637
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,400
You, don't move, don't move!
Stop resisting!

638
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,080
I said don't move! Spread your legs!

639
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,200
- Stop resisting!
- Give me your hand!

640
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,520
<i>We go out with a bang.</i>

641
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,680
- Let's go.
<i>- We'll go out the front door.</i>

642
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,680
<i>Liberté pour Assane Diop! Liberté...</i>

643
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,160
<i>The crowd that helped us get in
will keep the police busy.</i>

644
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,320
<i>They'll see us, but won't really look.
You get it.</i>

645
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,840
<i>We take our final bows.</i>

646
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,080
<i>And then, the curtain drops.</i>

647
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
Assane Diop!

648
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
We love you!

649
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,040
You're a mad man, Assane.

650
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,080
- I cannot believe we made it!
- Amazing job, guys.

651
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,240
Now that I paid you,
you think your sister will stop hating me?

652
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,080
We'll be happy
to never see you again.

653
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,640
This is your stop.

654
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,080
Meet me at the spot.

655
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,720
Person spotted on rooftops
near Place Vendôme.

656
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,040
Wait, it's Assane Diop!

657
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,160
<i>We don't have the location
of his transport. Confirm identity.</i>

658
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,880
I lost him. He's on the run.

659
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,320
<i>We're sending backup.</i>

660
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,320
Someone fell off the roof!
