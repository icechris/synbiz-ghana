- Hello.
- Hey.

Okay, everyone, let's move it.
We got a big night.

7
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,800
[Luis] So, this is the Queen's necklace?

8
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Yeah.

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,240
Next week, it goes up for auction.
Probably gonna go for 200 million.

10
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Well, shit.

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,640
It's okay, I'm sure you can afford it.

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
In a million years!

[coin rattles]

21
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
You look like shit, Assane.

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,000
You used to be so handsome.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,800
- Can't you afford a razor?
- [Assane] Sure.

24
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,640
- I just got myself a job.
- You got a job?

25
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Mm-hm.

26
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,040
- [woman] Oh, isn't that wonderful?
- Mm-hm.

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,040
- Congratulations!
- [Assane] Thank you.

29
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920
And what is it?

30
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,760
If I had to guess, I'd say

31
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,880
it's really complicated
and it won't last very long.

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Same as usual.

33
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,520
It might be nice
if you stopped hiding things.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
For us.

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
For our son.

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Can I see Raoul this weekend?

37
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,400
Of course you can see Raoul this weekend.

38

[distant siren wailing]

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,800
You think he's gonna want to see you?

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,080
- He's tired of being disappointed.
- I know I'm not the ideal father.

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,960
Well… Saturday at eight?

42
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,360
Saturday at eight.

43
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,480
- Things will change, Claire.
- Yeah, well, we'll see.

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
I'm gonna change.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,400
[Claire] Tell that to your son.

46
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,040
[Assane] I know I'm a bit late
for the alimony, but…

47
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,680
[Claire] Keep your money.
Buy a present for Raoul.

48
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
See you Saturday.

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,200

- Who's there?
- It's Perenna.

57
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Get in.

58
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,200
Got the money?

59
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,760
[Assane] There's a problem.
I don't have the cash.

60
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,880
I was wondering
if Vincent would be willing to...

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
- Oh! Hey!
- Come here.

62
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,320
- What are you doing? What do you want?
- [man] Out of the way, fucker!

63
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,360
[Assane] Hey! Wait, listen to me!
Wait, wait, wait. Vincent!

64
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Listen to me!

65
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,200
- Oh, shit! Wait!
- [Vincent] Where's my money?

66
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
[Assane] I don't have it.
I gave it to my kid's mom.

67
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,880
Oh! Oh, please. Give me more time.
Give me more time.

68
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,480
Interesting.
Maybe we should visit your kid's mom.

69
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,640
No!

70
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Fuck! Don't let me fall!

71
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Pull me up and I'll tell you
how to make some cash. A bunch of cash.

72
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,520
More money
than you'll ever be able to spend.

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm afraid of heights.
You can't keep me hanging like this!

74
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
Right, Kevin, get him up.

75
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,280
[Assane groans]

76
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
[car tires screeching on TV]

77
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm a janitor now.

78
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
At the Louvre.

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,760
- Sounds like a shitty job.
- [Assane] That depends.

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,480
The artwork I clean,
they're worth millions.

81
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,760
And they're within my reach.

82
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,720
- Every night.
- Okay, and how does this get me my money?

83
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
You'll get it.

84
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,840
<i>Next Friday,
a necklace will be put up for auction.</i>

85
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,280
<i>The necklace belonged to Marie-Antoinette
and it's worth millions.</i>

86
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
<i>Except the sale won't go
as planned because we…</i>

87
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,240
we're gonna steal it.

88
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
Okay, Kevin, throw him over.

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
[Kevin groaning]

90
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,240
- Fuck, seriously?
- You see? You underestimated me.

91
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,280
- [Kevin groans]
- You didn't look at me.

92
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
You saw me,

93
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
but you didn't really look.

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,080
- Just like they don't look.
- Who's "they"?

95
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,280
The people I work for,
everyone who lives on that side of town.

96
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,920
Everyone on top while we're at the bottom.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,160
They don't look.
And thanks to that, we're gonna be rich.

98
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,520
I need someone
who can be quick and decisive.

99
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,480
And someone with muscle.

100
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,120
And you need someone who knows the museum.

101
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,800
And what about me?

102
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
Oh, cool.

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,920
This is where the auction's held.
We gotta be careful.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
There's cameras everywhere.

105
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
Only one place doesn't have cameras. Here.

106
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,360
Janitors' locker room. They don't think
there's anything valuable there.

107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
A separate hallway.

108
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,200
<i>A separate entrance. A separate elevator.</i>

109
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
They don't want anyone to see us.

110
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,880
And that means they won't see you.

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,520
What do you mean, "you"?

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,720
You three go in as janitors
and come out millionaires.

113
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,160
And how do we get in?
Using our good looks?

114
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,200
- [Assane]<i> I'll get you in no problem.</i>
- Where's my badge? Shit.

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,680
The real question is,
how will you get out? They'll scan you.

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,960
Unless <i>you're taking out trash.</i>

117
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,920
<i>Or bringing in cleaning products.</i>

118
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,200
<i>Spray bottles can be filled with anything.
Bleach. Window cleaner.</i>

119
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,720
Or… chloroform.

120
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,920
When the auction starts,
you go to the locker room.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,560
There, Vincent and Kevin,
you'll steal the guards' uniforms.

122
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,880
You'll need 'em later.

123
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,680
And you, Rudy,
you go to the surveillance room.

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,920
<i>There's always one guy in there.
He's always sleeping.</i>

125
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,320
<i>So, nothing to worry about.</i>

126
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,840
<i>And then, you deactivate the cameras.</i>

127
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,360
<i>If the cameras are down for
over two minutes, the police are alerted.</i>

128
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,160
<i>Two minutes after that, they'll scramble.
In three minutes, they'll arrive.</i>

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,800
<i>Two plus two plus three.</i>

130
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,960
You have seven minutes not to get caught.

131
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,320
- What?
- It's tight.

132
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,600
But more than enough time
to get to the foyer

133
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
<i>where they keep the necklace
after it's sold.</i>

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,840
Grab the necklace and exit there,
and Rudy will be with the car.

135
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,640
A discreet, fast car
he will acquire for us.

136
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,160
And we're rich.

137
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,120
And here, observe all the pure gold
suspending a river of diamonds.

138
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
- Any questions?
- Any questions?

139
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,960
While we risk our asses,
what are you doing?

140
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Who, me?

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm buying the necklace.

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,560
[guide] Right, please follow me
for the rest of the tour. Thank you.

143
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,280
And this is where you work?

144
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,880
A big change from home!
Are your bosses cool?

145
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
Let's just say they're… presumptuous.

146
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,040
- "Presumptuous," Assane.
- Oh, Papa, seriously?

147
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,360
[dad] "Presumptuous."

148
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,080
P-R-E

149
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,280

152
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,280
Bravo, my boy.

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
- [chuckles]
- [thunder rumbling]

154
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,680

[engine spluttering]

156
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,520
[dad] Mrs. Pellegrini?

157
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,000
- Do you need some assistance?
- No.

158
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,240
No, no.

159
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Thank you.

160
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
It's me, madam.

161
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm Babakar.

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,120
Your husband's new chauffeur.

163
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh… I'm sorry.

164
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Excuse me. I didn't recognize you.
I'm sorry. I've got a small problem.

165
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Pop the hood for me, please.

166
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
All right.

167
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Hey, get in!

168
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,680
Where are you and your dad from?

169
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,640
Senegal, madam. Close to Thiès.

170
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,840
And your mom?

171
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
[thunder rumbling]

172
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
[hood closes]

173
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
Try it now.

174
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,280

175
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
Yeah, it's good!

176
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,920
Well, thank you very much. [chuckles]

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,400
- Let me drive you, madam.
- No, no, thank you.

178
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,080
No, I insist.

179
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,680
Well, then, all right.

180
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,360
Do you know
what they call men like your dad?

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
A gentleman.

182
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,600
Yeah, it's true.

183
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,640
- [Babakar laughs]
- [Mrs. Pellegrini] It's true.

184
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520

189
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,400
Good evening.

190
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,440
Thank you. Thank you so much.

191
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,840
- Good evening.
- Hello, sir.

192
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,040
- [woman] Good evening.
- [guard] Have a good night.

193
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,560
- Welcome, Mr. Paul…
- Sernine.

194
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,840
Thank you. Have a good evening.

Thank you, sir.

196
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,440
[auctioneer] Ladies and gentlemen,
dear friends, please take your seats.

197
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,840
The auction is about to commence.

198
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Hey.

202
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,320
Here you go. Good luck.

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,240
[auctioneer]
The legendary Queen's necklace.

204
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,480
The fabulous necklace whose very history
is intertwined with the history of France.

205
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,880
A gift from Louis XVI to Marie-Antoinette,

206
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,000
it disappeared during the Revolution
before resurfacing,

207
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,760
two decades later,
in the hands of Napoleon

208
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
who gave it to Joséphine de Beauharnais.

209
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,440
Then began an incredible journey
across all of Europe,

210
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,320
from Tsarist Russia
to the Great Palace of Constantinople,

211
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,760
finally ending up
as one of the secret treasures

212
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
of the Third Reich.

213
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
It was then purchased by our dear friends,
the Pellegrinis,

214
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,840
from whom it was stolen 25 years ago.

215
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
[Babakar] After you, sir.

216
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Open it.

217
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,760
Put the car in the garage.

218
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,120
- I don't want it in the rain.
- Of course, sir.

219
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,560
[auctioneer]
It was considered lost forever.

220
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,480
In reality, it had been dismantled

221
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,240
and the seven gemstones were scattered
to the four corners of the world.

222
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,480
But no one took into account
the tenacity of Hubert Pellegrini,

223
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,600
who tracked down every one of the gems.

224
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,240
And today, the reconstructed necklace
has finally returned home, here, in Paris.

225
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,040
Ladies and gentlemen, if you would,
please welcome the daughter of its owner,

226
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,880
the lovely Juliette Pellegrini.

227
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,720
[applause continues]

228
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,160
[Juliette] Good evening.

229
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,880
[pop song in French playing on radio]

230
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,400
[Assane]
Mrs. Pellegrini said I could use the pool.

231
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,480
Are you the son of the guy
who drives my father?

232
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,160
My name's Juliette.

233
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Now you respond.
It's called a conversation.

234
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
My name's Assane.

235
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
How old are you, Assane?

236
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
[Assane] I'm 14.

237
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Next week.

238
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,680
[Juliette chuckles]

239
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Tell me, Assane.

240
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,760
Is it true what they say about Blacks?

241
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,160
- What?
- [Juliette laughs]

242
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,280
What do you mean?

243
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,480
People say they can't swim.

244
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,080
- Well, I can swim.
- [Juliette] Oh, yeah?

245
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Can I see?

246
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
If you swim to me, you get a kiss.

247
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,920
It'll be a real kiss.

248
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,720
Not like your mom's.

249
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,680
[applause]

250
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,520
[inaudible speech]

251
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
[Juliette] Thank you. Good evening.

252
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,640
When my father reconstructed
this necklace,

253
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,240
he promised
that he'd do something special.

254
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,440
That's why tonight, proceeds from the sale

255
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,840
will help create the Juliette
and Hubert Pellegrini Foundation.

256
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,280
The foundation will support
future cultural and artistic projects…

257
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,080
You have my thanks.

258
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
[applause continues]

259
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
[auctioneer] Excellent.

260
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,160
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will now begin the auction

261
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,320
for the Queen's necklace.

262
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,560
We'll start the bidding

Central, we're checking the locker room.

266
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,400
[auctioneer] Well, perhaps we can set
a starting bid of 18 million,

267
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,040
as a warm-up, if I may suggest.

268
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
Right, who wants to bid 18 million?
Do I have 18 million?

269
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Eighteen million for Herr Kruger.
<i>Danke schön.</i>

You're not paid to read.

Excuse my husband's behavior.

306
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,720
He's concerned about his business.

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Yeah.

308
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
I understand.

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,080
Let's save some time.
I bid 60 million euros.

352
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,240
[audience gasping]

353
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,160
Did I hear you say 60 million euros?

354
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,400
Yes, you did.

355
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,040
Sixty million euros.
Sixty million euros? Very well, um…

356
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the hour of truth.

357
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,600
Sixty million euros.

358
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,080
- Ladies and gentlemen…
- I can't fucking breathe!

359
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,400
Do I have any other bidders
for the Queen's necklace?

360
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
No?

361
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,240
So, 60 million euros
for the gentleman going once…

362
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,880
Sixty million euros going twice…
Sixty million euros going thrice…

363
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,640
Sold to the gentleman. Well done!

364
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,800
Thank you.

365
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,960
Are you afraid he'll betray us?

366
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,320
He won't.

367
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
We'll do it first.

368
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Thank you.

369
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,520
- [panting]
- [clock ticking]

370
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Five minutes!

371
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,360
Five minutes!

372
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,800
[auctioneer] Everything seems to be
in order, so, thank you.

373
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,560
I must admit, Mr. Sernine, I wasn't
expecting someone like you as a buyer.

374
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,680
Like me?

375
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,640
What do you mean?

376
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
Well, I mean…

377
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
uh, well, so young!

378
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
[chuckles]

379
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,200
And here is your necklace.

380
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,040
Well, when your money transfer
is validated, of course.

381
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,280
Of course.

382
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,280
Mr. Pellegrini is very strict
about procedure.

383
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,480
In regards to that, his daughter
would like to meet you, in case you…

384
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,840
Uh… I don't think so.

385
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,080
Can I see it now?

386
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,160
For that price.

387
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,720
Just a little peek.

388
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,080
The necklace is my baby now.
You understand?

389
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,240
Of course.

390
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,560
All right.

391
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,680
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

392
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,520
[beeping]

393
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,320
[Hubert]
I always put the necklace inside the safe.

394
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,960
Can you get into this room? Yes or no?

395
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,280
Yes, but…

396
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,440
And you're well aware my safe is in here.

397
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,160
- No, I'm not.
- So you say.

398
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,480
I saw you lurking in here the other day.

399
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,560
I… I was dusting the bookshelves.

400
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,040
- Madam, you told me to...
- No, leave my wife out of this!

401
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,720
The truth is that Mr. Diop was found
in a precarious situation

402
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,520
which he pretends is an injustice.

403
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,120
To get revenge, he stole the necklace.

404
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,520
I swear on my son's life, I never...

405
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,440
- Who else was here?
- I have no idea!

406
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,480
Okay, calm down, sir.
At the station, we can clear this up.

407
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,000
- All right?
- Yeah, remove this, uh…

408
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,400
This what, huh?

409
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,120
- This what?
- [officer] Whoa. Calm down.

410
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,760
- Stay calm!
- Let go of me!

411
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,920
- Calm down, sir.
- I didn't do it!

412
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,160
- Let's go!
- [Babakar] Help me, Mrs. Pellegrini!

413
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,800
Tell my son!

414
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,200
I'm innocent!

415
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,640
Let me go!

416
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Voilà.

417
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Ah!

418
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Stop!

419
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,480
Okay, I'll humor you if you insist.

420
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,800
[engine running]

421
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,600
- Evening, sir. National police.
- Hello.

422
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,880
Turn off the engine if you're waiting.

423
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,720
Yes, of course.

424
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,720
[engine stops]

425
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,560
- Have a little respect for the planet.
- Yeah, exactly.

426
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,920
- [officer] All right, good night.
- Good night.

427
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,720
[sighs]

428
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,760
- [watch ticking]
- Come on, you guys.

429
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,520
- [groaning]
- Oh my God!

430
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,840
No, let's talk about this…

431
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
[groans]

432
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,280
[Assane groaning]

433
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,040
[groaning]

434
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,520
Hey! What are you doing?
You gotta get out!

435
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,080
[Assane groaning loudly]

436
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
[Vincent] Let's go!

437
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
[Assane] Help us!

438
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,440
- [muffled screams]
- We've been robbed!

439
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Stop, thief!

440
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,320
[alarm blaring]

441
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,640
[alarm blaring]

442
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,440
[indistinct chatter]

443
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,920
[screaming]

444
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,600
[man shouting]

445
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,280
[alarm beeping]

446
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,280
There was a robbery. No one can leave.

447
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,000
Wait, let me check with Central.

448
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,160
Fuck! Central! Two men escaping
through the maintenance staff's entrance!

449
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,440
[Rudy] Shit. Come on, come on!

450
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,600
What the hell is that?

451
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,720
What the fuck are you thinking, Rudy?

452
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
[engine starts]

453
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,760
- Is that what you call discreet?
- It's all I could get! Come on!

454
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,120
I'm gonna kill you!

455
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,600
[engine revving loudly]

456
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,920
[sirens wailing]

457
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,600
[tires screech]

458
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,320
[glass shattering]

459
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,920
- [keys jangling]
- [lock opening]

460
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,560
[men shouting in distance]

461
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,680
[guard] I'll get your father.

462
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Thank you.

463
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,600
- P3!
- [man] <i>Opening gate, P3.</i>

464
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
[gate buzzes]

465
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,960
[knocks on door] Diop. Visitor.

466
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,680
[knocks on door] Diop?

467
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Shit.

468
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,880
I need a doctor! Suicide in P3!

469
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,880
[distant thunder rumbling]

470
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
[melancholic music playing]

471
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,320
Hello, Assane.

472
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm very sorry.

473
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,920
If there's anything I can do…

474
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Yes, madam.

475
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Thank you, madam.

476
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Excuse me, madam.

477
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,680
Go fuck yourself, madam.

478
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
[shouting and groaning]

479
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
[Vincent grunting]

480
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,920
Rudy, I swear, I'm gonna kill you!

481
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,480
Vincent, I swear, it's not my fault!
I swear!

482
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,440
[grunting]

483
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,400
[Vincent]
It's that stupid, shitty car you took!

484
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,800
[Rudy] Got a little more torque
than I thought.

485
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,400
Let me go!

486
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,120
[Vincent] Kevin, stop it!

487
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,680
- [grunting]
- [Rudy] It's got really shitty brakes!

488
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,880
Nobody touch anything.

489
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,920
I want statements from everyone.
Both the staff and clients.

490
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,280
Mr. Sernine is a victim. You have no idea
how bad those thugs roughed him up!

491
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,160
We fought back, of course.

492
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,320
It's fine, Thibault.

493
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,600
The captain's just doing his job.
It's okay.

494
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,880
Hmm. I've never heard of your company.

495
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,200
What is it? Nanobay? What is it exactly?

496
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,160
Did you use your cell phone today?

497
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,400
- Well, yeah.
- Then you made me some money.

498
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,720
[cell phone rings]

499
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Mm-hm.

500
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
- Hello?
- <i>Captain, it's Guédira.</i>

501
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,400
We've taken the suspects into the station.

502
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,440
We'll interrogate them to see if they had
any accomplices in the museum.

503
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,040
- Did you find the necklace?
<i>- Yeah,</i> w <i>e got it back.</i>

504
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,520
- It's going to the lab for analysis.
<i>- Good.</i>

505
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,960
Captain, I have a question.
You know the adventures of Arsène Lupin?

506
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,280
What are you talking about, Guédira?

507
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,200
<i>There's this story about a necklace.</i>

508
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,120
It makes me think of Arsène Lupin.
I've read them all.

509
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,600
<i>Get back to the office
and wait for the results.</i>

510
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,560
Okay.

511
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,360
<i>- On it.</i>
- Okay, thank you.

512
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,960
We have the necklace
and the guys who did it.

513
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,200
- Go home. We'll call if we need you.
- Are you sure?

514
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,640
- Yes, it's fine. Go ahead.
- Thank you very much.

515
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,120
- Thibault.
- Mr. Sernine.

516
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,400
- We'll do the necklace another time.
- Yes. Thank you.

517
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
[Assane] Goodbye.

518
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
[Assane sighs]

519
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Mr. Sernine?

520
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
Do you mind?

521
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Want to search me?

522
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
[rustling]

523
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,200
[Assane] It's a souvenir.

524
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,520
Am I under arrest?

525
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,280
[captain sighs]

526
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,080
